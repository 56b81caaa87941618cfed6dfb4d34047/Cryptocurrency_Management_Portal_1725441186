The AI outlined a checklist of additional features to implement, which included options such as interactive contract components and customizable UI elements. Following this, the user specified a need for an ETH wrapping component related to the same contract. The assistant confirmed it was working on this task while asking about specific functionalities and design preferences.\n\nThe conversation progressed with the user requesting changes, such as altering the \"sheep counter\" to a \"number counter\" and customizing colors. The AI constantly provided options for better user interaction and design preferences, including various features like transaction history logs, customizable gas settings, and user-friendly tooltips, ultimately acknowledging each request.\n\nThe user also aimed to create components for interacting with Aave and token swaps. They specified details like enabling transaction history, providing real-time price updates, and ensuring a modern interface. Again, specific functionalities were discussed, including simple or detailed user interfaces for these components.\n\nOverall, the AI assistant consistently acknowledged the user\u2019s requirements and suggestions, ensuring that each component was tailored to the user\u2019s specifications while offering a comprehensive list of features for enhanced functionality and usability.",
